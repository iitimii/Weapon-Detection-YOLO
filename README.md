## Installation

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/iitimii/Weapon-Detection-YOLO.git```
2. Navigate to the project directory: ```cd Weapon-Detection-YOLO```
3. Install the required dependencies: ```requirements.txt```
4. Install YOLOv8: ```pip install ultralytics```

## Usage

1. Obtain a pre-trained YOLOv8 model for weapon detection or train your own model.

2. Run the weapon detection script:

Replace `/path/to/video/or/image` with the path to your input video or image, and `/path/to/model/weights` with the path to your trained model weights.

The script will display the processed video or image with bounding boxes around detected weapons and their corresponding labels.
